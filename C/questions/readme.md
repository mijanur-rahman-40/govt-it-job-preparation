### Pointer

Pointers are one of the things that make C stand out from other programming languages, like Python and Java. They are important in C, because they allow us to manipulate the data in the computer's memory. This can reduce the code and improve the performance.

Pointers are used extensively in both C and C++ for three main purposes: to allocate new objects on the heap, to pass functions to other functions. to iterate over elements in arrays or other data structures.



     - For passing the argument by using references.
     - For accessing the elements of an array.
    For dynamic memory allocation by using malloc() and calloc() functions .
    Used in arrays, functions to improve the performance of code.
    For returning multiple values.
    Implementing a data structure.
    For doing system-level programming.
