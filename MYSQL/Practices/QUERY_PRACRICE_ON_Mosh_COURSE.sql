-- the above code only return the matched customers but if you want to show the all customers who have any order or not
-- then we have to use OUTER JOIN

-- Outer joins are joins that return matched values and unmatched values from either or both tables. There are a few types of outer joins:
-- LEFT JOIN returns only unmatched rows from the left table, as well as matched rows in both tables.
-- RIGHT JOIN returns only unmatched rows from the right table , as well as matched rows in both tables.
-- FULL OUTER JOIN returns unmatched rows from both tables,as well as matched rows in both tables.

-- LEFT JOIN
SELECT 
    c.customer_id, 
    c.first_name,
    o.order_id
-- customers is a LEFT table
-- All the record from the left table are returned whether the condition is true or not
FROM customers c  
LEFT JOIN orders o
-- LEFT OUTER JOIN orders o
-- Condition
ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
ORDER BY c.customer_id





-- RIGHT JOIN
SELECT 
    o.order_id,
    c.customer_id, 
    c.first_name
-- orders is a RIGHT table
-- All the record from the right table are returned whether the condition is true or not
-- Here basically all the customer_id in orders table will exist in the customers table
FROM orders o 
RIGHT JOIN customers c
-- RIGHT OUTER JOIN customers c
-- Condition
ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
ORDER BY c.customer_id




-- RIGHT JOIN
-- Also RIGHT JOIN can be written as follows
SELECT 
    c.customer_id, 
    c.first_name,
    o.order_id
-- Here basically all the customer_id in orders table will exist in the customers table
FROM customers c 
RIGHT JOIN orders o 
-- Condition
ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
ORDER BY c.customer_id





-- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57095115/why-we-use-left-join-right-join-differently-we-can-get-same-output-from-left

-- There really is no difference between a LEFT JOIN and a LEFT OUTER JOIN. 
-- Both versions of the syntax will produce the exact same result in PL/SQL. 
-- Some people do recommend including outer in a LEFT JOIN clause so it's clear that you're creating an outer join, but that's entirely optional. 
-- The same is true of a RIGHT JOIN and a RIGHT OUTER JOIN. In the end, then, it isn't a question of a LEFT JOIN vs. LEFT OUTER JOIN. 
-- They're one and the same thing.

-- LEFT JOIN -> It is also known as LEFT OUTER JOIN. 	RIGHT JOIN -> It is also called as RIGHT OUTER JOIN.

-- ANY, ALL
-- ALL & ANY are logical operators in SQL. They return boolean value as a result.
-- ALL operator is used to select all tuples of SELECT STATEMENT. It is also used to compare a value to every value in another value set or result from a subquery.
-- The ALL operator returns TRUE if all of the subqueries values meet the condition. The ALL must be preceded by comparison operators and evaluates true if all of the subqueries values meet the condition.
-- ALL is used with SELECT, WHERE, HAVING statement.

-- SQL Aggregate Functions
-- Aggregate functions are often used with the GROUP BY clause of the SELECT statement. The GROUP BY clause splits the result-set into groups of values and the aggregate function can be used to return a single value for each group.
-- The most commonly used SQL aggregate functions are:

-- MIN() - returns the smallest value within the selected column
-- MAX() - returns the largest value within the selected column
-- COUNT() - returns the number of rows in a set
-- SUM() - returns the total sum of a numerical column
-- AVG() - returns the average value of a numerical column





-- UPDATE 
UPDATE customers
SET first_name = 'Alfred Schmidt', city = 'Frankfurt'
WHERE customer_id = 1;






-- HAVING : 
-- The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions.
-- The following SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country. Only include countries with more than 5 customers:
SELECT COUNT(customer_id) AS total_customers, city
FROM customers
GROUP BY city
HAVING COUNT(customer_id) > 1;

SELECT COUNT(customer_id) AS total_customers, city
FROM customers
WHERE city = 'Dhaka'
GROUP BY city;

SELECT COUNT(customer_id) AS total_customers, city
FROM customers
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY total_customers DESC;

-- Same output
SELECT COUNT(customer_id) AS total_customers, city
FROM customers
GROUP BY city
HAVING total_customers
ORDER BY total_customers DESC;

SELECT COUNT(customer_id) AS total_customers, city
FROM customers
GROUP BY city
HAVING total_customers = 3
ORDER BY total_customers DESC;

SELECT COUNT(customer_id) AS total_customers, city
FROM customers
GROUP BY city
HAVING total_customers > 1
ORDER BY total_customers DESC;






-- GROUP BY
-- It is followed by aggregate function
SELECT

  SUM(quantity) as quantity
FROM order_items
GROUP BY product_id;


SELECT COUNT(customer_id) AS total_customers, city
FROM customers

-- UNION 
-- The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.
-- Every SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns
-- The columns must also have similar data types
-- The columns in every SELECT statement must also be in the same order

SELECT name FROM products
UNION
SELECT name FROM shippers
ORDER BY name;





-- CASE 
-- The CASE statement goes through conditions and returns a value when the first condition is met (like an if-then-else statement). So, once a condition is true, it will stop reading and return the result. If no conditions are true, it returns the value in the ELSE clause.
-- If there is no ELSE part and no conditions are true, it returns NULL.
