#What is SQL?
-> SQL stands from Structured Query Language. It is used to communicate with several relational databases such as MySQL, Oracle and MS SQL Server. Using SQL queries, you can fetch, update, delete and manipulate data that is stored in the form of rows and columns. SQL became the de facto standard programming language for relational databases after they emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s. You can also permit users to perform specific tasks on tables, procedures, and views. SQL commands are divided into different types, such as data manipulation language (DML), data definition language (DDL), transaction control language (TCL), and data query language (DQL).
